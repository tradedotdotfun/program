## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Principal and Interest Calculation

Trade.fun employs a sophisticated mechanism to protect principal while distributing only interest as rewards. This is how the system works:

#### How It Works:

1. **Deposit**: Users swap SOL for INF tokens via Jupiter DEX

   - `initial_inf_price = total_inf_received / total_sol_deposited`

2. **Principal Protection**: Principal value is calculated and preserved

   - `principal_inf = total_inf * 100 / (100 + price_increase)`

3. **Yield Calculation**: Interest is determined from INF price appreciation

   - `price_increase = (current_inf_sol_price - initial_inf_price) * 100 / initial_inf_price`
   - `interest_inf = total_inf - principal_inf`

4. **Reward Distribution**: Winners receive interest_inf
   - `reward_amount = interest_inf * round_participated_chips / total_minted_chips`

This system ensures that:

- Principal remains safe and can be redeemed by depositors
- Only yield generated during the competition is distributed as rewards
- Participants can compete without risking their deposited capital

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v23+) and pnpm installed
- Solana CLI tools (v1.14+)
- A Solana wallet with SOL for deployment and testing

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trade-fun.git
cd trade-fun

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the program
anchor build
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your own wallet keypair path and Solana cluster:

   ```
   RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   KEYPAIR=your_string_private_key
   ```

### Quick Setup: TypeScript CLI Scripts

<table>

#### Initial Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install @solana/web3.js @coral-xyz/anchor ts-node

# Initialize admin
ts-node cli/initializeAdmin.ts

# Initialize the vault
ts-node cli/initializeVault.ts
```

</td>

ts-node scripts/endRound.ts
ts-node scripts/distributeZ.ts
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Testing

```sh
# Run the test suite
anchor test

# Run specific tests
anchor test -- -t "should initialize vault"
```

### Deployment

For local development:

```sh
# Start a local validator
solana-test-validator

# Deploy to localnet
anchor deploy
```

For testnet/mainnet:

```sh
