## üöÄ What is Trade.fun?

Trade.fun is an **influencer-driven trading game** built on **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)**, designed to make trading competitions more **transparent, engaging, and rewarding**. Whether you're a seasoned trader or just starting out, **Trade.fun** offers an exciting way to showcase your skills, earn rewards, and build a trading community.

## üåü Current Features

### Core Trading System

- SOL to INF token swapping via Jupiter DEX
- Round-based trading competitions with on-chain verification
- Yield delivered in ZBTC tokens via LST in Sanctum
- No-risk participation: only yield is distributed, principal remains safe

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Principal and Interest Calculation

Trade.fun employs a sophisticated mechanism to protect principal while distributing only interest as rewards. This is how the system works:

#### How It Works:

1. **Deposit**: Users swap SOL for INF tokens via Jupiter DEX

   - `initial_inf_price = total_inf_received / total_sol_deposited`

2. **Principal Protection**: Principal value is calculated and preserved

   - `principal_inf = total_inf * 100 / (100 + price_increase)`

3. **Yield Calculation**: Interest is determined from INF price appreciation

   - `price_increase = (current_inf_sol_price - initial_inf_price) * 100 / initial_inf_price`
   - `interest_inf = total_inf - principal_inf`

4. **Reward Distribution**: Winners receive ZBTC converted from yield
   - `reward_amount = interest_inf * round_participation_tokens / reward_token_supply`

This system ensures that:

- Principal remains safe and can be redeemed by depositors
- Only yield generated during the competition is distributed as rewards
- Participants can compete without risking their deposited capital

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v23+) and pnpm installed
- Solana CLI tools (v1.14+)
- A Solana wallet with SOL for deployment and testing

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trade-fun.git
cd trade-fun

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the program
anchor build
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your own wallet keypair path and Solana cluster:

   ```
   RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   KEYPAIR=your_string_private_key
   ```

### Quick Setup: TypeScript CLI Scripts

<table>
<tr>
<td>

#### Initial Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install @solana/web3.js @coral-xyz/anchor ts-node

# Initialize admin
ts-node scripts/initializeAdmin.ts

# Initialize the vault
ts-node scripts/initializeVault.ts
```

</td>
<td>

#### Running a Competition

```sh
# Start a trading round
ts-node scripts/startRound.ts

# Deposit SOL and participate
ts-node scripts/depositSol.ts

# End round and distribute rewards
ts-node scripts/endRound.ts
ts-node scripts/distributeSol.ts
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Testing

```sh
# Run the test suite
anchor test

# Run specific tests
anchor test -- -t "should initialize vault"
```

### Deployment

For local development:

```sh
# Start a local validator
solana-test-validator

# Deploy to localnet
anchor deploy
```

For testnet/mainnet:

```sh
# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Deploy to mainnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet-beta
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Insufficient funds error**: Ensure your wallet has enough SOL for transaction fees
- **Account already exists**: You may need to use a new wallet or reset your local validator
- **Invalid program id**: Make sure the program ID in `Anchor.toml` matches the one in `declare_id!()`
